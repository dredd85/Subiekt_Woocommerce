# Subiekt_Woocommerce
Welcome to my GitHub repository! Currently, I'm working on an early-stage project that involves analyzing a local database from Subiekt using T-SQL and comparing it to the database in Woocommerce, which uses MySQL. To gather the data, T-SQL will be directly extracted from the local database, while the data from Woocommerce will be obtained through its API.

The primary objective of this project is to identify any discrepancies between the two databases and develop solutions to streamline data management processes. As the project progresses, I'll update this README file to provide more details on the approach taken and the outcomes achieved. Stay tuned for further updates!
